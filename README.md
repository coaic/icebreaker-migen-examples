# iCEBreaker migen examples

This repository contains examples for the [migen](https://github.com/m-labs/migen) Python toolbox for building complex digital hardware.

You will need to have python3, migen and icestorm/nextpnr/yosys installed on your system.

After that all you need to do is connect your iCEBreaker to the computer and run the python script in an example directory.

The scripts are by default set to synthesize and upload the bitstream to the iCEBreaker board.
